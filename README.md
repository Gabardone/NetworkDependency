This is a simple abstracted network dependency built for use with
[GlobalDependencies package](https://github.com/Gabardone/GlobalDependencies).

Since it's built to needs and so far I have just needed to get data from the network that's all it has right now. As
other facilities are needed, whether by myself or other helpful users, its protocol will get new methods and its default
implementation will make them work.

## Requirements

Since the default `SystemNetwork` implementation of the dependency protocol uses Swift concurrency, it is only supported
on those versions of Apple platforms that support the language feature (major OS versions released in 2019 or later). 

### Tools:

* Xcode 15.1 or later.
* Swift 5.9 or later.

### Platforms:

* iOS 13 or later.
* macOS Catalyst 13 or later (but why?).
* macOS 10.15 or later.
* tvOS 13 or later.
* watchOS 6 or later.

## Installation

NetworkDependency is currently only supported through Swift Package Manager.

If developing your own package, you can add the following lines to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/Gabardone/NetworkDependency", from: "4.0.0"),
]
```

To add to an Xcode project, paste `https://github.com/Gabardone/NetworkDependency` into the URL field for a new package
and specify "Up to next major version" starting with the current one.

## How to Use `NetworkDependency`

Adoption should follow the steps described in the
[documentation for GlobalDependencies](https://gabardone.github.io/GlobalDependencies/documentation/globaldependencies/)),
but since the dependency is already built one just needs to add the import statement and the protocol conformance in the
`dependencies` property for types that do depend on this.

The documentation for `NetworkDependency` itself can be built from Xcode or found
[here](https://gabardone.github.io/NetworkDependency/documentation/networkdependency/)

## Contributing

If anyone decides to expand on this dependency (unsurprising as it's so limited so far) I would appreciate a PR with the
changes.

Same if anyone can come up with some unit tests for the existing logic. I was drawing a blank since there's so little of
it and it mostly calls the system frameworks.

Beyond that just take to heart the baseline rules presented in  [contributing guidelines](Contributing.md) prior to
submitting a Pull Request.

Thanks, and happy networking!

## Developing

Double-click on `Package.swift` in the root of the repository to open the project in Xcode.
