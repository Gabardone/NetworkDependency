# ``NetworkDependency``

A simple dependency built upon
[GlobalDependencies](https://gabardone.github.io/GlobalDependencies/documentation/globaldependencies/) that abstracts
away network access.

## Overview

The ``NetworkDependency`` package works both as a very simple example for how to use the
 [GlobalDependencies](https://gabardone.github.io/GlobalDependencies/documentation/globaldependencies/) package
to abstract away and modularize dependencies and as a basic dependency for projects that do not require advanced
network access options.

The package is minimalistic and will be built as needed. If you need more sophisticated or advanced functionality than
what is offered here do not hesitate to either build your own or help contribute to this package.
